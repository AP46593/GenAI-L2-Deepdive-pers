    Consider multiple options and evaluate each:

    Option A: Take the highway.  
        - Pros: Direct route  
        - Cons: Likely traffic jams

    Option B: Use the subway.  
        - Pros: No traffic, predictable timing  
        - Cons: May involve walking with luggage

    Option C: Take a side-road route using GPS navigation  
        - Pros: Might avoid traffic  
        - Cons: Longer distance, unpredictable

LLM response: 

Let's evaluate each option:

**Option A: Take the highway**

Pros:

* Direct route to the airport
* Can be faster if there is no traffic

Cons:

* Likely traffic jams during rush hour
* Increased risk of accidents and road closures due to heavy congestion

Rush hour can be a nightmare on highways, and the likelihood of traffic jams is high. While it may be a direct route, the stress and potential delays might make this option less appealing.

**Option B: Use the subway**

Pros:

* No traffic worries, as you'll be underground
* Predictable timing and frequency of trains

Cons:

* May involve walking with luggage (depending on airport access)
* Limited capacity if traveling during peak hours

The subway is a great option to avoid traffic, but consider that you may need to walk with your luggage after arriving at the airport. This might add extra time to your journey.

**Option C: Take a side-road route using GPS navigation**

Pros:

* Might avoid traffic congestion
* Can explore alternative routes and adjust in real-time

Cons:

* Longer distance traveled, potentially adding more driving time
* Unpredictable road conditions and potential construction delays

Using GPS navigation and taking a side-road route might help you avoid some of the highway's traffic woes. However, this option comes with added uncertainty regarding road conditions and potential construction delays.

Considering these factors, I'd recommend:

**Option B: Use the subway**

While it may require walking with luggage, the predictability and lack of traffic worries make the subway a reliable choice during rush hour. If you're concerned about luggage, consider using a luggage cart or porter service to minimize the hassle.

However, if you prefer driving, **Option C: Take a side-road route using GPS navigation** might be a good alternative. Just be prepared for potential detours and construction delays.

The highway (Option A) is not recommended during rush hour due to the high likelihood of traffic jams.

Remember to plan ahead, check traffic conditions, and adjust your route accordingly to ensure a smooth and stress-free journey!
