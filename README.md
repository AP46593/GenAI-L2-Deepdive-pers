Install VSCODE, Python, Ollama ( pull llama3:3B manifest)


Change the model in the py files - if you want to try other models instead of llama3:8B

For huggingface/openAi models - add a .env file with your api_keys in your project.


Do pip install for the required packages like openai, langchain, etc - depending on the py file you are trying to run.
